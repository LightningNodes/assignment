# Developing and Implementing a Market-Making/Trading Strategy on a Cryptocurrency Exchange

## Objective
To create and execute a market-making/trading strategy on a cryptocurrency exchange, analyze its performance, and provide detailed insights and recommendations based on the results. This is a hands on assignment and deeper understanding on the assignment is expected. Submit the output within a week.  

## Description

### Introduction
- Brief overview of market-making/applied strategy in cryptocurrency trading.
- Importance and challenges of the specific strategy.

### Preparation
- Choose a cryptocurrency exchange (e.g. Pi42, WazirX, Zebpay, Binance, OKX, Kraken, Coinbase).
- Select a trading pair (e.g., BTC/INR, BTC/USDT, MATIC/USDT).
- Set up necessary accounts and API access for automated trading.

### Data Collection and Analysis
- Collect historical price and volume data for the selected trading pair.
- Analyze the data to understand market behavior, volatility, and liquidity patterns.

### Strategy Development
- Develop a market-making/trading strategy focusing on placing both buy and sell limit orders to capture the bid-ask spread.
- Incorporate risk management techniques to mitigate potential losses (e.g., stop-loss orders, position size limits).
- Define key parameters such as order size, spread threshold, and frequency of order placement.

### Backtesting
- Backtest the developed strategy using historical data to evaluate its performance.
- Adjust the strategy parameters based on backtesting results to optimize performance.

### Implementation
- Implement the optimized strategy on the selected exchange using a trading bot or algorithm.
- Monitor the live performance of the strategy over a specified period (e.g., one month).

### Performance Analysis
- Collect and analyze performance metrics such as profit/loss, average spread captured, trade volume, and win rate.
- Compare the live performance with backtesting results to identify any discrepancies.

### Reporting
- Prepare a detailed report summarizing the strategy development process, implementation, and performance analysis.
- Provide insights on the effectiveness of the strategy, any encountered challenges, and recommendations for further improvements.
